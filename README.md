# Predictive-Analysis-of-Bank-Marketing
Using decision tree classifiers, this project predicts customer responses to bank marketing campaigns. It analyzes data to optimize campaign targeting, improve marketing strategies, and boost subscription rates through effective data-driven insights and visualizations.
Certainly! Let's elaborate further on each section with detailed explanations and code examples:

# Project Overview
The "Predictive Analysis of Bank Marketing Data" project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a bank's product or service. This prediction is based on comprehensive demographic and behavioral data collected during marketing campaigns. By accurately predicting customer behavior, banks can enhance their marketing strategies, optimize resource allocation, and improve campaign effectiveness.

## Dependencies

This project relies on several Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, machine learning, and model evaluation:

- **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis, such as loading and cleaning datasets.
  
  Example from the code:
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  ```

- **numpy**: Provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, essential for numerical computations.
  
  Example from the code:
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  ```

- **matplotlib**: Enables the creation of various types of plots and graphs to visualize data distributions and trends.
  
  Example from the code:
  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  ```

- **seaborn**: Works in conjunction with matplotlib to provide visually appealing statistical graphics, enhancing data exploration.
  
  Example from the code:
  ```python
  import seaborn as sns
  ```

- **scikit-learn**: Implements machine learning algorithms, including decision tree classifiers, for model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Features

### Data Analysis

Explore and understand the dataset:

- **Dataset Shape**: Check the dimensions of the dataset to understand the number of rows and columns.
  
  Example from the code:
  ```python
  print("Dataset shape:", data.shape)
  ```

- **Column Names**: Display the names of columns in the dataset for reference and identification of features.
  
  Example from the code:
  ```python
  print("Columns:", data.columns)
  ```

- **Data Types**: Provide an overview of data types present in the dataset, helping in initial data preprocessing steps.
  
  Example from the code:
  ```python
  print("Data types:\n", data.dtypes.value_counts())
  ```

### Data Preprocessing

Prepare data for model training:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Use SimpleImputer to fill missing values in numerical and categorical columns.
  
  Example from the code:
  ```python
  numerical_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='median')
  X[numerical_cols] = numerical_imputer.fit_transform(X[numerical_cols])

  categorical_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')
  X[categorical_cols] = categorical_imputer.fit_transform(X[categorical_cols])
  ```

- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Use LabelEncoder to transform categorical variables into numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
  
  Example from the code:
  ```python
  label_encoders = {}
  for col in categorical_cols:
      le = LabelEncoder()
      X[col] = le.fit_transform(X[col])
      label_encoders[col] = le
  ```

### Model Training and Evaluation

Train a decision tree classifier and evaluate its performance:

- **Train-Test Split**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets for model validation.
  
  Example from the code:
  ```python
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
  ```

- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Use scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier to build and train a predictive model.
  
  Example from the code:
  ```python
  classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
  classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
  ```

- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the classifier's performance using metrics such as accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
  
  Example from the code:
  ```python
  accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
  conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
  class_report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
